# coursera_algorithms
Workings for the coursera algorithms course taken 2021

Each directory contains the working out for each week on the course

1. Haskell Karatsuba method multiplication

3. Scala QuickSort (not using haskell as proper haskell implementation is currently outside of my
	 skill-set)

# coursera_algorithms
Workings for the coursera algorithms course taken 2021

Each directory contains the working out for each week on the course

1. Haskell Karatsuba method multiplication
2. Haskell Merge Sort
3. QuickSort (Scala, not using haskell as proper haskell implementation is currently outside of my
	 skill-set due to use of in place memory switching)
4. Karger Min Cut (Scala, not using haskell as requires randomness which I haven't used in Haskell
	 yet)
5. Kosaraju Strong Connected Components (SCC) finder, Haskell
6. Dijkstra, Scala (so I can use an in memory efficient heap implementation)
7. Median Maintenance, Haskell as I have already made a heap in scala for the last exercise
8. 2-Sum algorithm, I did in Haskell writing multithreaded code, but a better solution could be done
	 in future (`8/README.md`)
9. Task Scheduling in Haskell, and Prim's MST in Scala

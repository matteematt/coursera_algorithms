# coursera_algorithms
Workings for the coursera algorithms course taken 2021

Each directory contains the working out for each week on the course

1. Haskell Karatsuba method multiplication
2. Haskell Merge Sort
3. Scala QuickSort (not using haskell as proper haskell implementation is currently outside of my
	 skill-set due to use of in place memory switching)
4. Scala Karger Min Cut (not using haskell as requires randomness which I haven't used in Haskell
	 yet)
5. Haskell Kosaraju Strong Connected Components (SCC) finder

1. Consider a connected un-directed graph with distinct edge costs. Which of the following are true
[click all that apply]

* The minimum spanning tree is unique
True

* Suppose the edge e is the most expensive edge contained in the cycle C. Then e does not belong to
any minimum spanning tree
No, it would be part of a path

* Suppose the edge e is the cheapest edge that crosses the cut (A,B). Then e belongs to every
minimum spanning tree
True

* Suppose the edge e is not the cheapest edge that crosses the cut (A,B). Then e does not belong to
any minimum spanning tree
True


2. You are given a connected undirected graph G with distinct edge costs, in adjacency list
representation. You are also given the edges of a minimum spanning tree T of G. This question asks
how quickly you can recompute the MST if we change a single edge. Which of the following are true

5. Recall the greedy clustering algorithm from lecture and the maximum-spacing objective function.
Which of the following are true? [Check all that apply]

* This greedy clustering algorithm can be viewed as Prim's minimum spanning tree, stopped early.
True

* Suppose the greedy algorithm produces a k-clustering with spacing S. Then, if x,y are two points
in a common cluster of this k-clustering, the distance between x and y is at most S.
True

* If the greedy algorithm produces a k-clustering with spacing S, then the distance between every
pair of points chosen by the greedy algorithm (one pair per iteration) is at most S.
True

* If the greedy algorithm produces a k-clustering with spacing S, then every other k-clustering has
a spacing at most S.
False

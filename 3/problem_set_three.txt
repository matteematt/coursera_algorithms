0 < a < .5

For a randomly chosen pivot element, what is the probability that the length of the smaller split is
>= a times the size of the original array

For a = 0
100% ?
Because the smallest split will be at least more than 0 as long as the pivot is not Z_0

For a = .5
~0% ?
Because the smallest split can only be equal to 50 % of the array when the pivot is Z_(n/2)

For a = .25
75%?
Because the smallest split will be more than a quarter if the pivot is anywhere from Z_(n/4) to Z_(n)

=> 1 - 2 * a (not too confident on this)
=> Correct

2.
For an array of length k the recursive calls generate arrays between ak and (1-a)k, where a is the
same fixed constant as the previous question. How many recursive calls can you occur before you hit
the base case? Express you answer as a range of possible values of d

Could be as low as zero because you could try and sort an array of length 1 or 0?

=> 0 < d < - log(n)/log(a)
=> Incorrect - Note there is also a non-trivial lower bound on the minimum number of recursive calls
before triggering the base case

Guessing as it has the same term as q 1
=> -log(n)/log(1-2*a)
=> Incorrect

=> By process of elimination answer is -log(n)/log(a) <= d <= -log(n)/log(1-a)

3.
Defined the possible range of recursion depth of quicksort

Maximum theta(n) because the pivot could be the lowest or highest unsorted value every time which
would require recursion for every value in the array

Minimum theta(log(n)), if the pivot is zi/2 every time then the arrays will be split like merge sort
which is log(n) depth

=> Minimum Theta(log(n)); Maximum: Theta(n)
=> Correct - The best case is when the algorithm always picks the median as a pivot, in which case
the recusion is essentiall identical to that in merge sort. In the worse case the min or max is
always chosen as the pivot resulting in linear depth

For a group of k people with birthdays uniformly across 365 days. What is the smallest value of k
such that the expected number of pairs of distinct people with the same birthday is at least one

Indicator I_xy denotes that persons x and y share the same birthday

I_xy = 1/365

For two people then

for i in range (0,1):
	for j in range (0,1):
		when i /= j:
			I_xy = 1/365

1 >= k^2 1/365

365 <= k^2

k >= 19.10

=> 20
=> Incorrect - Double check how many inidicator random variables you have. Are you double-counting
pairs?

For two people then => 1/365
For three people then => 2/365 + 2/365
For four people then => 3/365 + 3/365 + 3/365
for n people then => n2/365

	=> This gives me the same answer as last time

For two people then => 1/365 * 1/365
For three people then => 1/365 * 1/365 + 1/365 * 1/135 + 1/365 + 1/365 = 3/365^2
For n peole then = n / 365^2

For each person 1/365 so
=> 366
=> Incorrect. This is the minimum k such that the probability of having a duplicate birthday is
100%. But for the question asked here, the correct answer is much smaller

Probability of sharing a birthday = 1/365
Pairs of n people given by nC2 = n(n-1)/2
1 < n(n-1)/2*365
730 = n^2 - n

1+-sqrt(1-4*1*-730)/2*1
1+-sqrt(2921)/2
=> 27.5231...
=> 28

5.
Let X1, X2, X3 denote the outcomes of three rolls of a six-sided die (uniform distribution).
Let Y = X1 * X2
Let Z = X2 * X3

Which of the following statements are correct?
Y and Z are independent, but E[Y*Z] /= E[Y] * E[Z]
Y and Z are not independent, and E[Y*Z] /= E[Y] * E[Z]
Y and Z are independent, and E[Y*Z] = E[Y] * E[Z]
Y and Z are not independent, but E[Y*Z] = E[Y] * E[Z]

E[Xn] = 3.5

=> Y and Z == 12.25

=> Y and Z are independent, but E[Y*Z] /= E[Y] * E[Z]
=> Incorrect. This is impossible because the expectation of a product of independent random
variables is always the product of their expection

=> Y and Z are independent, and E[Y*Z] = E[Y] * E[Z]
=> Correct
